<p>Descrepencies: While I gave a 1 on procedural abstraction, collegeboard gave a 0. This is because I neglected the fact that the program did not explain how the procedure contributed to the overall program</p>

<p>Descrepencies: I gave a 1 while collegeboard gacve a 0 on Algorithm Implementation. I assumed that a sign of algorithmic implementation was good enough to get the point, but now I know that the algorithm must be intuitive, and complete the task in the most efficient was possible.</p>

<p>Descrepencies: I gave a 0 as collegeboard gave a 1 for program purpose and function, as well as managing complexity. This is because I keep making the assumption that this will be graded in the english way, with emphasis on the explanation, and I always forget how the emphasis is on the code and its purpose.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection:</h1>

<p>Notes for my own create performance task</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t put as much emphasis on the Algorithmic implementation, and focus more on the abstraction</li>
  <li>Be sure to explain each section well in an easy to read format for the graders</li>
  <li>The program purpose should be a purpose and not describe the function</li>
  <li>it should either explain the problem being solved or the createve idea behind making the program.
A submission can fail to meet the requirements in 2 ways.
    <ol>
      <li>The evidence with the code example is overly simple or not present</li>
      <li>a poor explanation exists, not connecting with the code much.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
