</table>

<p>Descrepencies: I gave the Algorithm implementation a 0, as collegeboard gave it a 1. This is because I assumed iteration through a small list would be considered trivial, but apparently now  I know 3 is an okay number for useful iteration.</p>

      <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>

      <td>1</td>
      <td>no separate code, and all 3 algorithmic apporach didn’t seem to be present</td>

      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Well explained tests, testing different types of inputs.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Descrepencies: I gave a 1 while collegeboard gacve a 0 on program purpose and funtion, as I initially thought the purpose statement was good, but forgot to look at the function part, which wasn’t as stellar. For Procedural abstraction and algorithm implementation, I gave a 0 while collegeboard gave a 1. As a coder with a bit of a more algorithmic background, I was probably expecting a little bit more than the scope of the course from the people I graded.</p>

      <td>0</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Descrepencies: I gave a 0 as collegeboard gave a 1 for program purpose and function. This was becuase I thought that the purpose sounded like a function, but collegeboard didn’t think so. In addition, I thought the testing was bad but passable, but collegeboard said it was a zero.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection:</h1>

<p>Notes for my own create performance task</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t put as much emphasis on the Algorithmic implementation, and focus more on the abstraction</li>
  <li>Be sure to explain each section well in an easy to read format for the graders</li>
  <li>The program purpose should be a purpose and not describe the function</li>
  <li>it should either explain the problem being solved or the createve idea behind making the program.
A submission can fail to meet the requirements in 2 ways.
    <ol>
      <li>The evidence with the code example is overly simple or not present</li>
      <li>a poor explanation exists, not connecting with the code much.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
