Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns in professional wrestling history.Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a career as a bodybuilder, and switched to professional wrestling in 1999 before making his debut for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW).

He won his first singles title, the United States Championship, in 2004. The next year, he won the WWE Championship, and his character soon changed into a clean-cut and heroic one. He led the company as its franchise play\n"
