    "My Notes:\n",
    "- Procedures can be called recustively, meaning th same procedure can be called inside the procedure. However, for this to work, there must be some else, break, or exit case, or else the function will keep calling itself forever\n",
    "- python uses def to define a procedure but javascript uses function\n",
    "- in both languages, if you want, you can have a return statement which returns whatever you would like, and stores it in a variable if the function is set equal to a variable in the main code. \n",

    "## <mark>Homework/Hacks</mark>: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
