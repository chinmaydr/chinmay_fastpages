    "# Why SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is a preprocessor language that is compiled into CSS, which means that SASS code is translated into CSS code, which is what your web browser can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SASS vs SCSS\n",
    "As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used."

    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this [one](https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the repository, head over to `assets/css/`, and open `style.scss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you can create your SASS code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to `_site/assets/css/style.css`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears.\n",

    "# Nesting:\n",

    "Sure! Here are some bullet points on nesting in SASS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SASS allows for nesting of CSS rules, which can make the code easier to read and organize.\n",
    "- To nest a rule in SASS, simply indent it under the parent rule.\n",
    "- For example, to nest a `ul` element inside a `nav` element, you could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nav {\n",
    "  ul {\n",
    "    /* nested CSS rules go here */\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also nest pseudo-selectors and media queries in SASS.\n",
    "- It's important to be mindful of over-nesting, as it can lead to overly-specific CSS and make the code harder to maintain."

    "What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Take notes here:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extend\n",
    "- `@extend` is a feature in SASS that allows you to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.\n",
    "- This allows you to keep your CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "- Syntax: `@extend selector;`\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  .button {\n",
    "    padding: 10px 20px;\n",
    "    background-color: blue;\n",

    "    padding: 5px 10px;\n",
    "    font-size: 12px;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - The `.button-small` class extends the styles of `.button` while also adding some new styles specific to `.button-small`.\n",
    "  - The resulting CSS will have the styles for `.button-small` and `.button` combined, so `.button-small` will have `padding`, `background-color`, `color`, and `font-size` properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "- SASS supports inheritance through the use of the `@extend` directive.\n",
    "- Inheritance allows you to create a base style and extend it to child selectors.\n",
    "- This is useful for creating consistent styles for elements that share similar characteristics.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  %button {\n",
    "    padding: 10px 20px;\n",
    "    background-color: blue;\n",
    "    color: white;\n",

    "    padding: 5px 10px;\n",
    "    font-size: 12px;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - `%button` is called a placeholder selector, and it defines a set of properties that can be extended by other selectors.\n",
    "  - `.button-small` extends `%button`, and the resulting CSS will have the styles for `.button-small` and `%button` combined."

    "\n",
    "1. Variables: Sass allows you to define variables that can be reused throughout your stylesheets. This makes it easy to make global changes to your styles by simply changing the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```scss\n",
    "$primary-color: #007bff;\n",

    "button {\n",
    "  background-color: $primary-color;\n",
    "  border-color: $primary-color;\n",
    "  color: #fff;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Operators: Sass allows you to perform basic math operations on values, making it easier to create complex styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scss\n",
    ".container {\n",
    "  width: 100%;\n",
    "  max-width: 960px;\n",
    "  margin: 0 auto;\n",
    "  padding: 30px;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  @media (min-width: 768px) {\n",
    "    padding: 50px;\n",
    "    width: 75%;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Control Directives: Sass provides several directives that allow you to control the flow of your code, including `@if`, `@for`, `@each`, and `@while`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scss\n",
    "@for $i from 1 through 12 {\n",
    "  .col-#{$i} {\n",
    "    width: 100% / 12 * $i;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Partials: Sass allows you to split your styles into smaller files, called partials, which can then be included in your main stylesheet using `@import`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scss\n",
    "// _variables.scss\n",
    "\n",
    "$primary-color: #007bff;\n",
    "$secondary-color: #6c757d;\n",

    "// main.scss\n",
    "\n",
    "@import 'variables';\n",
    "\n",
