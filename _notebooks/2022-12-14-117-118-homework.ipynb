    "- Typically, it is good if something can be achieved in polynomial time, because it meand that if one operation takes one second, x operations take x  seconds\n",
    "- on the other hand exponential efficiency would mean that each operation takes more time than the previous, like a program that would calculate a factorial\n",
    "- Polynomial efficiency can nave varying levels, like n^2, n^3, n^4, and so on\n",
    "- Exponential efficiency is linke 2^x, 3^x, or 4^x\n",
    "- A heuristic approach is to sacrifice a 100% guarantee of a correct answer to save on time and complexity\n",
    "  - heuristic approaches can be helpful in cases where a 100% correct solution isn't necessary"
