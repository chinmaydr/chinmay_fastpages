By wrapping this method call in a try/except block, any potential exceptions can be caught and handled in a controlled manner. For example, if the user object is missing required fields or there is an issue with the database connection, the try/except block can be used to handle this error and take appropriate action, such as rolling back any changes or returning a specific error message."
