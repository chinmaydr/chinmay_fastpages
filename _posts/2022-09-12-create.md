# Rank everything app
- Show ready screen with input box
- prompts user for name of list
- maintain a list of all the items in ranked order
- repeat the following until user inputs "DONE":
    -  once name is given, prompts user for first item
    - initially keep the best item as the first and the worst item as the last
    - repeat the following steps until best item is the same as worst item:
        - ask the user if the item is better or worse than the middle of best and worst;
        - if it is better, worst becomes the middle
        - if not, best becomes the middle
    - add the new element to the location that has been found
- after it is over, show all the elements in sorted order with numbers for the rankings
- maybe also have settings for music, backgrounds, and themes
