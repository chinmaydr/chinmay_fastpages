# 1.2 video 1:
- Lots of different computing innovations
- guiding questions(social media):  
  - why does innovation exist?(communicating over a long distance)
  - what problems does it solve?(save time and money required to communicate with someone far away)
  - what does it allow us to do that we previously couldn't?
# 1.2 video 2:
- input is something taken in by a user(text, audio, video, text, touch)
- output is what the program does or returns to you passed, usually based on the input(same types as above)
- events are initiated through input
- code is not necessarily in order
  - segments are triggered when event occurs
# 1.2 video 3:
- program = collection of statements
- group of statements = code segment(executed according to event)
- description of code segments state what it does so a person could use it for their own purpose.
