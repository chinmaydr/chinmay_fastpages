  - An open protocol isn't owned by any company or organization, and are accessible to anyone on the internet. They create a standardized system for anything on the internet to use, making devide to device communication easier
# Night at the Musuem:
-  The night at the musuem event was quite enjoyable, as I was able to see not only projects from my fellop APCSP and APCSA students, but I was able to look at a lot of cool projects from other fine arts classes which I found interesting.
-  Other APCSP and APCSA projects:
   -  A calendar website which allowed you to add and remove events
   -  A clock app which enabled you to see the time in several countries, use a stopwatch or timer
   -  An APCSA group made a project that allowed you to input as many numbers as you like, and it would give you statistical data relating to those numbers
- A suggestion that I would make to improve the event would be to include some kind of suggested guide or order to make sure all visitors got a glimpse at every class's work.
