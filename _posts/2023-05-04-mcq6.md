## Reflection:
This was definitely my worst MC score, and this score doesn't guearantee a 5 on the AP exam unless I get a 6/6 on the CPT, which I don't want to risk. All of my wrong answers were either stupid mistakes or internet based questions, meaning I need to rewatch those videos and understand the topics more, as well as do more practice to ensure the silly mistakes dont continue.
