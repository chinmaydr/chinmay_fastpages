<li>simulations are computers representing real world ideas</li>
<li>they can accurately represent situations under considerations<ul>
<li>however, simulations may not be fully accurate, as they contain error</li>
<li>thse errors are called bias</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>simulations can be used in:<ul>
<li>video games</li>
<li>molecular and chemical models</li>
<li>predicting how machines will work</li>
<li>flight simulator</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we can use random values to represent real world randomness like weather</li>
<li>Simulations save time and effort and money of building andtesting a real thing</li>

<li>The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias</li>
<li>The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. ANSWER</li>
<li>If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation.</li>

<li>Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results.</li>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output. ANSWER</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences.</li>

<li>The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.</li>
<li>The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment ANSWER</li>
<li>The simulation will accurately predict the parachute's safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design.</li>

<pre>A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.
1. The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias 
2. The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. 
3. If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. 
4. The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output.

What is an advantage of using a simultion as opposed to building and testing something in real life?
1. It&#39;s more fun 
2. It&#39;s the trend 
3. Computers can simulate with 100 percent accuracy no matter the conditions 
4. It can produce more reliable reliable results, and save time and money

Ashlynn is an industrial engineer who is trying to design a safer parachute. She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment?
1. The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.
2. The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment
3. The simulation will accurately predict the parachute&#39;s safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design.
4. The simulation can test the parachute design in a wide range of environmental conditions that may be difficult to reliably reproduce in an experiment.

Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?
1. No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results.
2. No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment.
3. Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output.
4. Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences.

Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company. She is developing a baseball bat that can hit balls with higher accuracy and asks their software engineering team to develop a simulation to verify the design.Which of the following details is most important to include in this simulation?
1. Realistic sound effects based on the material of the baseball bat and the velocity of the hit
2. A depiction of an audience in the stands with lifelike behavior in response to hit accuracy
3. Accurate accounting for the effects of wind conditions on the movement of the ball
4. A baseball field that is textured to differentiate between the grass and the dirt

What is a simulation that includes variables that would be different in real life called?
1. Bias 
2. Abstraction 
3. Experimentation
