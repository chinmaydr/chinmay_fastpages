## Dopamine Issues:
- I would say that these issues are definitely real. There are many things that can distract a person from school, health, and relationships, but video games are a major one. I've seen people who are very addicted to video games. I've never really played, and when I have, I've been really bad at video games, so I've never had this problem. However, something which distracts me a lot is youtube, and a lot of times when doing work, I get distracted by youtube, and lose sight of the task at hand

## Reflection:
1. In a digital world, one can empower themself by using all the technology at their hand to good use, and use coding or other technology to create somehting beneficial to everyone, weather it be something simple like a game or small invention to help people, or something complex like a website to help people or a machine.
2. An empowered person can help someone who is not so lucky by involving them with their projects, or getting them started on new projects that they will like. They can also tell them what worked best to empower them so that the other person can use those suggestions to empower themselves.
3. Something which may be blocking digital empowerment at DNHS is all of the websited blocked ont he wifi. While blocking websites like games or innapropriate sites make sense, I don't see the purpose in some of the blocked websites that I have come across. For example, once I came acoss a periodic table site that was blocked. Another example is once I needed to research a part for robotics to see if it would work, but the company website was blocked. While I 100% understand blocking discord, it makes communication a hastle, and people use texing, snapchat, or vpns anyway.
4. In my opinion, digital divide is an issue, but not one that isn't easily overcome by people being more open and sharing their resources with others
