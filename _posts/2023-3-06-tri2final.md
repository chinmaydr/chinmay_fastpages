## Missed Questions:
### Question 2:

#### Explanation: 
I had confused public and private encryption keys, and assumed that any kind of encryption key meant that people had acess to encrypted data like passwords, social security numbers, adresses, and more. However, public encryption keys by nature do not compromise security and are meant to be posted online for people to see. In fact, public encryption keys are used to recieve information from the internet. An email address doesn't at all compromise security, as a password is needed to log into any website using gmail. No gmail or g-suite applications are availiable without a password, so nothing is compromised. An ip address only lets a person  know what your device is, but doesn't let them hack into it or anything. This leaves option A, cookies. Cookies on a website can save any information you enter and give someone with malicious intentions valuable information.

### Question 3:

#### Explanation:
We can immediately eliminate C, as we can assume that the company has good intentions and isn't trying to purposely install malware on the customers' computers. There would be no other plausible way for malware to be installed, so it makes no sense. D is illogical in a similar way, since a customer does not provide any private encryption key over the phone, so that information doesn't get saved. In addition, the operator has no acess to any customer accounts, so there would be no private encryption key to get. I had initially thought that it was B, as the user may be able to get the system to store bad things they say, but that information will always be reviewed by professionals who can filter out bad content, making it more foolproof. This leaves A, which still isn't likely, but could happen if the customer happens to reveal information like purchases or credit card number, or even name and/or address.

### Question 12:

#### Explanation:
Every option other than A is an email from a person who you don't have previous contact with, or soemone who wouldn't initially have contact with before the email. However, a phishing attach is when someone poses to be someone that you would know and trust and may already have your information. A good example of this is option A, where the attack is coming from someone who pretends to be someone from your bank, so you wouldn't immediately know or suspect a phishing attack.

## Reflection:
I did pretty well on this MC, earning myself an "A" grade on it. However, by one point, this is also my lowest MC score out of the practice MCs that we have taken in this class. I think it's because this test had the most theoretical questions, as opposed to practical questions, which I am usually better at. My worst topic in this class is usually privacy, encryption, and security, and all of the questions that I got wrong related to this. On the other hand, I got all of the coding related questions correct.
