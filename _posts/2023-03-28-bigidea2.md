#### Explanation: 
Answer C is wrong because it only includes information about students who have a grade point average greater than 3.5 and play at least one sport, which is a subset of students who play at least one sport. This means that the analysis would only be based on a limited sample of students who may not be representative of all students who play a sport.

Answer A is the correct choice because it includes information about all students at the school and those who play at least one sport, which allows for a comparison between the two groups of students. By combining Spreadsheets I and II, the teacher can determine the grade point averages of students who play sports and those who do not. This would provide a more accurate representation of the entire student population and allow for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Reflection:
I did pretty well on this MC, earning myself an "A" grade on it. I think I did really well on this exam, and only missed one question. However, a lot of this exam had repeat questions from previous practice exams, so it wasn't that impressive. Overall, I think I'm on the right track toward getting a 5 on the AP Exam.
