## 1:

|Reporting Category|My Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The student didn't meet the requirements, since they lacked a clear use of the program, but the function is clearly defined. I'd give this a 0.5 if I could|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The student sucessfully did data abstraction, through their use of math to manipulate numbers|
|Managing Complexity|1|0|I thought the student met the requirements because they explained how they used lists to amplify the program.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|The studednt did all the dos and didnt do any of the dont's|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|The student used different types of algorithms to enhance their program|
|Testing|1|1|The student passed, because they did diffeerent tests for thweir code in the video and the writeup|

## Differences 
My score and collegeboard's score was mostly the same, but we differecd on the score for managing complexity, as I thought that they deserved the point, but I didn't realize that they failed to explain how the program would have been different without the lists, which was a requirement.

|Reporting Category|My Scoring|College Board Scoring|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|1|The student didn't meet the requirements, as they didn't clearly describe the purpose and function|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The student had code explaining the acess and use data|
|Managing Complexity|0|1|The student didn't meet the requirement as the explanation was vague.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|The student used functions int he program|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|The student used different types of algorithms |
|Testing|1|1|The student had different calls for testing|

## Differences

I had 2 discrepencies, both of which I was grading harder on. It shows that I overestimated the difficulty. I think that I was grading in an english as opposed to CS way

# Criteria

### 6 criteria for create performance.
- Program Purpose and Function
- Data Abstraction
- Managing Complexity
- Procedural Abstraction
- Algorithm Implementation
- Testing

Ideas:
- Some kind of database
- A collection website for card collectors
- Fantasy online
