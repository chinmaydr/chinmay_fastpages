## Missed Questions:
### Question 35:

#### Explanation: 
I had assumed that if a musician used a nondigital sound source then there would be no way for copyright claims to be tracked, as you can't trace a person who recorded a nondigital source. However, that doesn't make it legal as a person can still have rights to that music, both digitally and nondigitally, and someone could sue you for copyright infringement if they listen to it and hear the same sounds. The only way that the chance of a copyright violation is very low is if the producer has a no-rights reserved Creative Commons license, as that mean that anyone can use their music(under specific terms).

### Question 65:

#### Explanation:
The variable count in the program is incremented by one every time the loop runds, so that x is added to zero y times. The only problem is that count is always incremented by 1, meaning it never decreases. This becomes a problem when y is negative, as count will keep getting bigger, and never hit zero. In this case, the program will cause an infinite loop and either keep running until the user stops it, the computer dies, or the IDE realizes that it will run forever and cut it out. I put the answer C, as I didn't read the question properly, and I assumed that if a positive x and a negative y wouldnt work, then the vice verse would also be true. This is not the case as it would work, since the negative value of x is added to zero y times, revealing the answer x*y

## Reflection:
I did pretty well on this MC, earning myself an "A" grade on it. However, as we are nearing the AP exam, I am trying to narrow down on topics that I'm having trouble with. The main topic that I am having trouble with is encryption and security in general, as those questions are confusing to me. Most of the code tracing or completing code questions I understand, which is a majority. I just need to study this one topic.
